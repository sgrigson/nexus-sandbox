  text: "{{GM}}Before you stands a stunning elven woman, one of the most enchanting you\'ve ever seen. Her features are flawless, and the light touch of makeup she wears accentuates her beauty. Her pouting mouth holds a firm line, keeping her inner thoughts in reserve. At her side stand two very formidable-looking bodyguards. Their faces are a blank slate, and their eyes are cold--the eyes of murderers, obviously augmented and trained for battle. They eye you up as if merely waiting for an opening. When she opens her mouth to speak her voice is warm and possesses a trace of an elvish accent, and you feel yourself drawn by her words despite yourself.{{/GM}}"
